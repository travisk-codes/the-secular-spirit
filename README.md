## What this is, who we are, and how to live
This text is primarily written by Travis Kohlbeck, with hope that others contribute corrections, notes, feedback, and citations, among other things.

The separation of entities is an illusion. There is only one thing, that thing is a wave, and that wave is called God. Because there is really only one thing, we should live our lives as though it were literally true (because, if you have faith, it is). This means that I am God. You are God. that speck of dirt over there? God. You cannot separate an object from the rest of reality, the entirety of reality literally defines it. So we should live as though you and I are the same, as though you and an animal are the same, as though you and the planet are the same, as though you are God, and should be treated the way God should be treated.

This text will have citations two levels deep. The first main text will be as close to simple english as possible, avoiding established names for the physical concepts involved (e.g. not a "particle", but a "particular point-like energy"), the second will provide context and elaboration using full english, and the third will contain personal information and opinions (such as how one should live their life if all this were true)
