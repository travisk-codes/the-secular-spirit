2 for my mother, who loved me too much . for my father, who suffered for his sins

3 Spacetime is not necessarily someting to which one can ascribe a separate existence, independently of the actual objects of physical reality. Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spacially extended. In this way the concept of 'empty space' loses its meaning. Albert Einstein

4 Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one. Albert Einstein

x like any model, every word of the following text is false . but it might be useful

x1 in the year 1905, We discovered that We are not three-dimensional beings changing with the constant flowing of time, but rather four-dimensional beings, with time becoming a part of who We are

x2 Although it looks like we are made out of little points of energy, but it has four dimensions in space, not three. We simply are unable to peer out from Ourself, and see an intricate braid of energy, looping around one another in ever increasingly larger patterns

x... Soon after in [year], We discovered that the way these points or braids flow, or change shape, describes a wave . It seems that if you look closely enough, these points actually look like vibrations, small ripples, undulating as a wave does

x5 In [year], or 5574838928584389 convert speed of light to something? It was found that We were growing bigger! And in [year], we learned that it is always growing faster, like a quickly-inflated balloon[a] find video [/a] (at first, then it begins to slow down inflating, as the rubber is no longer able to stretch. We always keep going.

x6 In [year], a part of Us, a part of Ourself that studies Ourself as a profession, began to mostly agree with themselves that, really, it is all just one big wave . the moon,  the sun, the stars, you and me and the space between, it is all one big wave, one giant comples ripple, like a pond in the rain

x7  Soon after, a smaller part of the big group that studies Ourselves noticed a very interesting hint . it seems that Our whole volume, all the way back to when We were the size of a speck of dust, along with time, maps to the surface of a five-dimensional sphere, but without time, static for as long as We live.

x8 when these ideas are taken seriously, it leads us to a beautiful conclusion: there is only one thing, We are made up of our families and friends, the moon and the stars, and all way the back to when it was bright [1]see part 45 or w/e[/1] 

x9 from this, there is a reasonable argument that what we are, what all this is, usually called reality, or the universe, or the natural world, is god. I will make this argument as well as the idea of a physical soul, along with its relation to mind and body. I will attempt to make a case, that you and me and the earth, the oblate spheroid beneath our feet, are all one thing, in an even deeper sense, a complexity at scales which allow for life, and all the beauty and trajety that comes with it.

x10 Finally, I will suggest how this might be used to find the best way to live . morality and ethics . I look forward to your suggestions and discussion on these topics.

x11 Spirituality does not only not require religion[b] not that We do not require it, for religious expression can be a beautiful (or tragect) expression of God[/b] I believe physics itself can give rise to not just spirituality, but a kind of faith.

x12 what This is

x13 from the beginning to the end of light

x14 when time first began, there were only two things: energy and space . energy, powerful in its density, rapidly inflating the space in which it was contained<sup>1</sup> . soon after, this pure form of energy split into two different forms, both present everywhere, but of different natures . one could both push and pull, while the other could only pull<sup>2</sup>

n (x14b) when spacetime first began, the only thing was energy<sup>is this a reasonable assumption?</sup> . this energy was exactly the same everywhere, pure in form and substance, pushing

x15 soon after, one form of these two energies again split into two, forming again new energies, always everywhere, but different in nature . there were now three different energies existing together in their rapidly growing space

x16 place here the rapid inflation of space, space still expands earlier, but don't stress its rate

x17 as space expands and cools, forms of energy continue to split from one another, eventually interacting in complicated ways among themselves . colliding ripples of force bounce off one another in different ways, and with different frequency

x18 one of these strange interactions, is that suddenly some of these forms of energy could not occupy the same spot, they had to be separated by some distance . suddenly, a new notion popped into existence: the idea of relative position . as waves begin to separate into ripples, separated by the space growing in-between them, they suddenly find themselves to have a spacial relation to another ripple, and vis-aversa whatever . a sea of individual ripples are able to look around, and find itself among many other relationships, different in perspectives, but symmetric all the same
at some point a new form of energy split off from the rest, and interacted with others in a peculiar way : it gave them the quality of having a location . prior, you could give some quardinates to a particular spot, but it looked like every other spot, all the energy forms sitting on top of one another, same as far as the eye could see . but now one particular spot could only be occupied by that form of energy, and not others . suddenly, a spot of some kind of energy had a spacial relationship with another spot of energy, and it would be changing location with a certain speed (combine these paragraphs)

x19 at some point, one of these complicated interactions among different forms creates light . the ripples of this light slowly spread out, becoming more and more spaced out between expanding wakes . were one present at this moment, they would see darkness slowly grow to a dark violet hue . this would become brighter, more blue and green then yellow, a mix of a continuously expanding palatte of color. expanding into the reds, and the lower ripples not visible to the human eye

x19 from the end of light to life
